# Data-Model
This project was part of my Nanodegree program, and its objective was to develop a data model and a Power BI report for Seven Sages Tea Company (SSTC). 
The project involved consolidating data from various departments within the company. 
The resulting data model enables the CFO of SSTC to efficiently assess the performance of different tea beverages, identifying the top-selling products and those contributing the most to profitability.
